## Control Flow
Bullet Points: [Walk us through how your app would work - how the user would interact with it, starting from the initial screen. e.g. Users are initially presented with a splash screen, where they can log in or browse as a guest. Once done, they see a curated list of some of the newest and coolest cat outfits. Tapping on a cat outfit entry takes you to that cat outfit's listing page.]
